# STOCK MARKET VISUALIZATION

[LIVE SHINY APP](https://narejo.shinyapps.io/stocks/)  
Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) is main stock exchange in Pakistan. There is no free source of stock prices trend. I have used R to collect raw, merge and visualize in Shiny.

My main objectives for this project are;

1. Collect raw data from [Pakistan Stock Exchange](https://www.psx.com.pk/) website.  
2. Process and filter custom data
3. Save custom data in .Rdata format for quick access.
4. Use Shiny to display this to public.
5. Add additional details to the app (company description, financial summary, etc).
